This repository contains my take on a web UI for the Pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co).
I had originally intended on providing a CodeIgniter (https://codeigniter.com/) PHP wrapper to handle log-ins and saving starred Pokemon across sessions but ultimately dropped it due to time and focused on the front-end.

**************************
Third Party JS / CSS Frameworks + Resources
**************************

The primary framework used in the project's development was React.JS (https://reactjs.org/) using Redux (http://redux.js.org/) for state management.
SASS (http://sass-lang.com/) was used as the CSS pre-processor with gulp (https://gulpjs.com/) handling my SCSS + JS build scripts.

Usage

Simply load index.html in the root directory.
